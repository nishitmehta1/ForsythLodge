ver 1.5.4  [ 27/1/2017 ] - packed for Hotel Xenia 1.1 release

 - WIDGETS: Updated several widgets according to the latest parameters index methodology. These widgets are not included on any theme yet, so it's safe to work
 - SHORTCODE: PROFILE GRID | BASE: Added order by date selection HEALTHFLEX-81
 - SHORTCODE: ANY POST LOOP | BASE: Correction for the amenities option dependency configuration...we need this field only on room CPT
 - SHORTCODE: ANY POST LOOP | BASE:  Fix for the return of get_templates_dependency() method. Apparently VC dependency functionality needs an array with default PHP array keys ( 0 => value1, 1 => value2, etc. )...in example, if an array was starting as 1 => value 1, it would not apply the dependency! . I fixed this using on the return value the array_values() function, which resets the keys properly.
